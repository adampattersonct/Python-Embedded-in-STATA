# Python-Embedded-in-STATA

The do files were part of a PhD level econometrics class in which STATA was the source of instruction,
but are really written in the Python language. Our classmates had to check our work as part of homework assignments, 
thus I had to submit work in STATA. I researched how to embed Python into STATA. 
This is hard to do on MAC so I bought a Microsoft for the class.
I wish to develop better Python skills as I can really see the total net benefit. 
I also learned that STATA does not like Python visualization packages. Given my research contract and the other PhD classes I had to complete, 
I could not time efficiently figure out how to get the wald test running in one of the homeworks. As I researched these codes and techniques myself, it often took me a little longer than I had planned to complete these homeworks.
